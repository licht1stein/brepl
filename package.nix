      brepl is a lightweight Babashka-based nREPL client designed for quick,
      one-shot interactions with Clojure nREPL servers. It supports expression
      evaluation, file loading, and sending raw nREPL messages, making it
      perfect for scripting, editor integration, and command-line workflows.
